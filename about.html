The high level of OFW families in the community is also a potential market because of more disposable income. Cagayan de Oro City is getting more congested with an inherent problem of traffic which will encourage people in the area to patronize local hospital because of ease and accessibility.

                                    What will make the hospital stand up against its competition is the service segmentation it will provide to its target market. With the expertise, training and experience of the healthcare providers in these fields, the creation of a unique medical services like the EN.T-HEAD AND NECK CENTERS, EYE CENTER, PLASTIC SURGERY CENTER, ENDOSCOPY, and INDUSTRIAL AND OCCUPATIONAL MEDICINE will be the unique selling proposition of the hospital. These specialty centers will be the first and only in the area which will be complemented with state of the art equipment. Considering its strategic location within the vicinity of an industrial estate and robust economic development among the adjoining towns, it will position itself as a Level 1 hospital provider in the locality. It will become an industrial healthcare provider for employees of the various companies. Again, with implementation of UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE LAW, it will become the primary care provider of the community and the first level referral center in the service delivery network.

                                    WEAKNESS A. NEW BUSINESS as a pioneering healthcare provider in the area, the challenges of how to increase the level of awareness and actual utilization of the [services] B. DEVELOPMENT OF A CORPORATE CULTURE - as a new hospital with start-up employees, untested operational system, and undetermined clinical outcomes, the challenge is how to inculcate and nurture a culture of competence, safety, compassion, quality, and better outcomes C. TIGHT LABOR MARKET - the current scarcity of Nurses, Radtech and Medtech pose a big challenge in the availability of manpower complement. Government hospitals are offering higher salaries which private hospitals cannot afford. Private hospitals in Cagayan de Oro are now offering higher rates than the minimum wage.

                                    THREATS A. GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS  a. DOH REGULATORY MANDATES - these regulations are sometimes difficult to comply because of inherent barriers which hospitals have no control.

DELAYED IN THE PAYMENT OF PHIC REIMBURSEMENT- lately PHIC has been delayed in paying their obligations due to financial constraints. This will greatly affect the liquidity of hospitals, and will increase the cost of money. c. DELAYED IN PAYMENT OF DSWD/PCSO/LGU HOSPITAL ASSISTANCE B. COMPETITION  a. The possibility that PHIVIDEC will put up its own hospital. b. Advent of a Level 1 Provincial Hospital in Villanueva, Misamis Oriental 

                                    OPPORTUNITIES  A. PASSAGE OF UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE. This mean that more patients are covered with PHIC which is a big market to serve. B. RAPID INDUSTRIALIZATION OF THE AREA -the influx of big industries in the area has improved employment rate, more disposable income and employees' health benefits. C. BETTER EDUCATION D. CHANGE IN DEMOGRAPHICS E. INABILITY OF THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO DELIVER HEALTHCARE SERVICES F. AVAILABILITY OF HOSPITAL FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE FROM DSWD, PCSO, LGU 

                                    The unique selling proposition of the hospital is the specialty care centers that is established and will be further developed and improved. The creation of the E.N.T-HEAD AND NECK CENTER, EYE CENTER, PLASTIC SURGERY CENTER AND ENDOSCOPY CENTER and INDUSTRIAL and OCCUPATIONAL MEDICINE is the primary differentiating market segments of the business. The services of these specialty centers will be the main product menu of the hospital which will be provided to health consumers along the eastern part of Misamis Oriental. These specialty care centers will be the first and only in the locality, and it will be positioned as centers of excellence. The specialty centers will be manned by highly trained, experienced, and competent specialists. To ensure high level of quality and safety, the centers are provided WITH STATE OF THE ART equipment like MICROSCOPE, VIDEO ENDSCOPY SYSTEM, etc. The centers are also located in ergonomically designed rooms with embedded information technology infrastructure.

                                    To promote, increase level of awareness and maximize utilization of services, the following strategic activities are now implemented:

                                    A. EYE CENTER: [ The assumption is anchored on increase population of senior citizens which will translate to high incidence of degenerative diseases like Cataract, Retinal diseases and Glaucoma. These Senior Citizens are financially protected because of automatic inclusion into the PHIC]  1. Tie-up with Senior Citizens  2. Tie-up with Local Government Units  3. Intensive Linkages with Community Health Workers like Barangay Health Workers and Rural Health Nurses  4. Networking with companies and HMOs  5. Case Rate only (PHIC) payments for 4Ps and LGU sponsored patients  6. Special Packages (Lower Co-Payments) for Middle Income Patients  7. Free Screening Clinics in Various Barangays in coordination with Barangay Government Units  8. Free Transportation if with MOA with Municipalities 

                                    B. E.N.T-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY: [The assumption is based on the branding that the main owner of the hospital has created for the past thirty years in his practice as an otolaryngologist]. 1. Same strategic activities as in the Eye Center  2. Strengthened hearing and vestibular rehabilitation services like providing free hearing test and hearing aids to indigent patients (Public Relations Programs to Promote Services)  3. Regular "PASILIP PROGRAM-VIDEOENDOSCOPY OF THE THROAT" for teachers in the community who are exposed to hazards of voice abuse.

                                    C. PLASTIC SURGERY CENTER: [The assumption is based on the need of the area, and the owners are facial plastic surgeons and general plastic surgeon.]  1. Same strategic activities as in the Eye Center  2. Networking with international non-government organizations which are involved in cleft-lip and palate surgeries like SMILE TRAIN, ROTARY CLUBS AND PHIL. BAND OF MERCY. 3. Massive information campaign on the availability of a plastic surgeon who can perform micro-vascular operation (one and only in Mindanao).

                                    D. DIAGNOSTIC AND THERAPEUTIC ENDOSCOPY: [The assumption is based on the availability of video endoscopy system and doctors who are trained to do it.]  1. Same strategic activities as in the Eye Center  2. Massive information campaign with emphasis on the being the only endoscopy provider in the area.

                                    REVER MEDICAL CENTER, INC., as a Level 1 Hospital, provides In-Patient Care, Out-Patient Care, Diagnostic X-ray Services and Clinical Laboratory Services to all ages of patients. The location of the hospital is a magnet in the locality because of its accessibility. It is also a SMART hospital having information technology infrastructure embedded in the building like LAN and wireless internet, and also a hospital information system. The hospital might also be considered a green hospital because it has its own rain water catchment facility and water source from natural spring. It is also the hospital in the locality that will have its own oxygen generating factory with centralized piping system to all rooms. These attributes are internal strengths which will lower the hospital operating costs and eventually lower its pricing which is a competitive advantage considering the economic level of the residents of the locality.

                                    To enhance the utilization of the services of a Level 1 hospital, the strategic activity will be focused on an ideal pricing scheme. The pricing mechanism will be lower but still profitable considering the expected lower operating cost. The procurement of medicines and supplies will be rationalized as to secure safe and quality items. With the implementation of the Universal Healthcare, it is expected that 90% of the population will already be covered with PHIC. This will provide financial protection to a lot of patients. PHIC coverage alone is a gargantuan market to serve. The hospital as one of its strategic marketing programs is to accept patients with PHIC reimbursements as the only payment. This will especially be promoted among 4P's and LGU sponsored patients. This program, aside from revenue generating, will also support and work in achieving the goal of the government and that is the achievement of the universal health care. It is part of the social corporate responsibility of the hospital to build better community through affordable and quality healthcare.
